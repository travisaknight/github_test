"[Verse 1]
> Now this is a story all about how
> My life got flipped turned upside down
> And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
> I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
> 
> [Verse 2]
> In West Philadelphia born and raised
> On the playground is where I spent most of my days
> Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
> And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
> When a couple of guys who were up to no good
> Started making trouble in my neighborhood
> I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
> And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
